# FUTURE_FS_01
A responsive Personal Portfolio Website developed using HTML and CSS to present my academic background, technical skills, projects, and certifications in a structured and visually appealing layout. The website includes multiple sections such as Home, About, Education, Skills, Projects, Certifications, and Contact, allowing visitors to easily navigate and understand my profile. It highlights my abilities in programming, web development, and problem-solving while also providing direct links to my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub for professional communication. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and understanding of basic web design principles.
